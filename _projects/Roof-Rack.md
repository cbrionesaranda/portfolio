## Purpose
RANCS Research Group is focused on the development of Cooperative Driving Automation. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, one of the cars of interest, had a collision issue with the LIDAR. The sensor needed to be raised by at least 30 cm.

## Design

With a budget of $200, and a sensor valued at over $10,000, the design had to be extremely reliable, resistant to vibrations and drag forces. In order to maximize the TRL (Technology Readiness Level), many off-the-shelf parts were used. 1010 aluminum extrusions were linked through pins and fixed supports. All parts were outsourced from McMaster
