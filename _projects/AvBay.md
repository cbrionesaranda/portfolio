## Purpose

A requirement of the USLI competition is to recover the rocket via dual-deployment, which involves the use of two parachutes that activate at different key points. In order to fulfill this requirement, it is necessary to have programmable control over the deployment of said parachutes. The avionics bay tackles this issue by including two redundant off-the-shelf altimeters, which upon reading the desired altitude level, trigger a small detonation inside the rocket. This controlled explosion causes the separation of the airframe into multiple sections. This is a bit similar to stages on rockets like the SLS. However, after separation, the airframe are still connected via a shock cord, releasing the desired parachute.


## Separation Feature

The main and drogue parachute are connected to the top and bottom of the avionics bay respectively. Both ends hold 5 grams of black powder, which upon trigger, increase the pressure inside of the airframe, exceding the shear stress of the shear pins causing failure. The failure of the shear pins is necessary to separate the sections.


## Extra Features
Extra features were included in the design of Avionics Bay. It has telemetry and recording capabilities.
