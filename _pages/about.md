I'm Cesar - an undergraduate mechanical engineering student and researcher at the University of South Florida, graduating in May 2026. Currently, I am leading the development of a an active air braking system, while competing in national rocketry competitions and conducting research in corrosion activity analysis.

I have extensive experience in CNC programming and operation, Design for Manufacture and Assembly, FEA, CFD, data analysis, and years of experience in technical writing/documentation. I enjoy working on challenging multi-disciplinary projects in a collaborative and creative way, especially when these projects involve innovating and maximizing available resources.
