I'm Cesar Briones - an aspiring engineer, researcher and student at the USF Department of Mechanical Engineering, graduating in May 2026. I currently lead the development of active drag-based braking system, compete in national rocketry competitions, and research in corrosion activity analysis.   

I have demonstrated project experience in iterative design, DFA, DFM, subtractive and additive manufacturing, modeling and optimization of constrained physical system, technical documentation and data analysis. I enjoy working on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects addressing problems with a creative solution. Check out some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

Here are some of my creations.
