I'm Cesar Briones - an engineer, researcher and student at the USF Department of Mechanical Engineering, graduating in May 2026. I currently do research in active drag-braking dynamics, rocketry national competitions, localized corrosion impedance analysis, and manufacturing of nano-ribbons.  

I have demonstrated project experience in design, fabrication, modelling and optimization of constrained physical systems, scientific software, and technical communication. I enjoy working on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects in emerging technologies. Check out some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).
