I'm Cesar - an undergraduate mechanical engineering student and researcher at the University of South Florida, graduating in May 2026. Currently, I am leading the development of a an active air braking system, while competing in national rocketry competitions and conducting research in corrosion activity analysis.

I have demonstrated project experience in iterative design, DFA, DFM, subtractive and additive manufacturing, modeling and optimization of constrained physical system, technical documentation and data analysis. I enjoy working on challenging, multi-disciplinary projects addressing problems with a creative solution. Check out some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects).

Here are some of my creations.
